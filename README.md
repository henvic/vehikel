[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/henvic/vehikel.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/henvic/vehikel)

## Presentation
This is built based on the [MediaLab](https://github.com/henvic/MediaLab) project.

## Requirements
Unless otherwise referenced to, the versions for the requirements are given by the install script or other way.

### PHP and Servers
* Unix-like system
* [PHP](http://php.net/) >= 5.4.x
* [MySQL](http://www.mysql.com/) >= 5.1
* [memcached](http://memcached.org/)
* [Gearman Job Server](http://gearman.org/)
* [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) >= 0.10.x
* [ElaticSearch](http://www.elasticsearch.org/) >= 0.90.x
* [CasperJS](http://casperjs.org/) >= 1.1-beta1
* [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/) >= 1.9.1

Please note that the default memcached is insecure by design because it's freely accessible from everywhere. You must restrict access to it yourself.

### Extensions
* [memcached](http://php.net/memcached)
* [GeoIP](http://www.maxmind.com/app/php) (you need a MaxMind's database service for that, this library will be changed soon)

### ElasticSearch plugins
[elasticsearch-action-updatebyquery](https://github.com/yakaz/elasticsearch-action-updatebyquery)


### PHP Libraries
* [Zend Framework](http://framework.zend.com/)
* [Symfony](http://symfony.com/) (some components)
* [HTML Purifier](http://htmlpurifier.org/) (use the standalone version)
* [PHP Password Library](https://github.com/rchouinard/phpass)
* [Imagine](https://github.com/avalanche123/Imagine)

You will need PHPUnit to test the code.

For performance you want to strip the require_once's from the Zend framework code, see [How can I optimize my include_path?](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/performance.classloading.html)

### Client-side dependencies
* [Bootstrap, from Twitter](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/)
* [jQuery](http://jquery.com/)
* [jQuery.fn.autoResize](https://github.com/padolsey/jQuery.fn.autoResize)
* [YUI 3](http://yuilibrary.com)
* [Tablesorter](http://tablesorter.com/)
* [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org)
* [jQuery-maskMoney](https://github.com/plentz/jquery-maskmoney/)
* [jQuery Zoom](http://www.jacklmoore.com/zoom/)
* [Galleria](http://galleria.io/)


### Services
* [Amazon Web Services S3](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/) - static assets are stored with Amazon S3
* [Twitter API](https://dev.twitter.com/) - ([create your key](https://dev.twitter.com/apps))
* [GeoIP by MaxMind](http://www.maxmind.com/) - (get a [free] database, note we use a custom PHP extension rather than theirs)
* [reCAPTCHA](http://www.google.com/recaptcha) - captcha service

## Install

On your CLI (command-line interface):

```
npm install
cd bin
./install-vendors.sh
./install.php
```

*For development you will want to respond with "development" on the question about the application environment*


This will take care of setting application paths, downloading and setting up the dependencies.
It will write a `application/configs/Environment.php.dist` similar to [application/configs/Environment.php](https://github.com/henvic/vehikel/blob/master/application/configs/Environment.php), with the choosen timezone and directory and file paths.

If a extension is missing you will know it.
You can get most of them with [PECL](http://pecl.php.net/) or apt-get on a Debian-based system such as Ubuntu.

For example, if mongo were missing you could use:

```
sudo pecl channel-update pecl.php.net
sudo pecl install mongo
echo extension=mongo.so >> /etc/php.ini
```

### Create the databases structures
MySQL tables have to be built. The DB scheme is at *[application/configs/db.sql](https://github.com/henvic/vehikel/blob/master/application/configs/db.sql)*

### Points of entry
There are two modules: default and services. And also a simple redirector system.

#### The services module
There is a CLI based services module.
Point of entry: *bin/services*

#### Web based points of entry
* *public/index.php* for the default
* *public-redirector/index.php* for the redirector system

You have to set up your web server configurations with regard to these. Use virtual hosts.

#### Rewrite rules
If you use Apache as your web server, the following rewrite rules might be used so the system receives the requests sent to it:

```
RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} -s [OR]
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} -l [OR]
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} -d
RewriteRule ^.*$ â€“ [NC,L]
RewriteRule ^.*$ index.php [NC,L]
```

For performance and to avoid the trouble of dealing with .htaccess I recommend not to use it (and disable it), instead put this on a Apache configuration file. Some text that might help you make a wise choice: [Remove index.php From URLs](http://expressionengine.com/wiki/Remove_index.php_From_URLs)

Note /index.php is hard-coded to return a 404 Not Found to make sure you do the proper thing and to avoid duplicates.

#### Search engine
Set the entry-point */search-engine* to the search service with a reverse proxy.

#### Static assets
Set the static/ directory to the entry-point */static/**.

**Important**: unless the JS template files are processed to be native JS code, it has to be this way otherwise XHR restrictions will affect the system as documented on the [XHR restrictions section of the text plugin](https://github.com/requirejs/text).

For production you should use a CDN service (such as S3 + CloudFront) to serve them, after processing them to create .js files.

### Image system
[thumbor](http://github.com/globocom/thumbor) is used to abstract the needed processing of the images uploaded by the users.

As of now, it is assumed to be working with a basic installation (as in, the "safe" signing option is not being used).

In a brand new install the placeholder might be set like this:

```curl -i -H "Content-Type: image/jpeg" -H "Slug: vehicle-image-placeholder.jpg" -XPOST http://localhost:8888/image --data-binary "@vehicle-image-placeholder.jpg"```

On success, the image ID will be returned as a new location and then should be copied to application.ini's ```services.thumbor.placeholder```.

Jcrop is used along with the Thumbor to provide a nice cropping feature to the end-users.


## Functional testing
Use `casperjs test add.js` to create random products pages out of thin air.

Add a `settings.json.dist` file to use custom configuration, instead of modifying the original on the `tests/functional` path.

There is a `tests/functional/providers` submodule with data providers for the functional tests.


## Scheduled tasks
Some operations might be expensive. For example: if a user removes his account it is not smart to start a batch delete operation of all his files right away (and let him waiting for it, for instance).
A way to solve this and other similar issues is to make use of a scheduled task to run from time to time and do this heavy work.

Gearman is being used to serve tasks.

## ElasticSearch (search engine)
The search is built on top of ElasticSearch (using a JSON RESTful API), with the help of Gearman. You should install the elasticsearch-action-updatebyquery plugin with:

`./bin/plugin --install elasticsearch-action-updatebyquery`

This search currently indexes the account profiles and posts, but only return the search results of the posts.

For effect of simplicity we assume you just installed ES on localhost.

### Preparing Elasticsearch
If you want to redo this process, before proceeding do the following to remove your data: `curl -XDELETE http://localhost:9200/posts`

From the `application/search/es-configs/` directory:

1. Add the typeahead suggestion analyzer with `curl -XPOST http://localhost:9200/posts?pretty=1 -d @posts-settings.json`

2. Verify it with `curl -XGET http://localhost:9200/posts/_settings?pretty`

3. Ceate the user mapping with `curl -XPUT http://localhost:9200/posts/user/_mapping?pretty=1 -d @posts-user-mapping.json`

4. Verify it with `curl -XGET http://localhost:9200/posts/user/_mapping?pretty`

5. Create the post mapping with `curl -XPUT http://localhost:9200/posts/post/_mapping?pretty=1 -d @posts-post-mapping.json`

6. Verify it with `curl -XGET http://localhost:9200/posts/post/_mapping?pretty`

Then you are ready to use ES.

The PHP back-end is used to call the ElasticSearch for indexing purpose.

There are two actions currently available via the service module:

1. For syncing the user profile on the posts: `./services --controller search --action sync-user-profile-on-posts --uid <uid>`

2. For rebuilding the entire posts: `./services --controller search --action sync-user-profile-on-posts --uid <uid>`

When the user changes the user profile data a gearman task is created, it is watched by the node.js worker, which calls the PHP syncing process.

A node.js server, serves as a simple "smart proxy" to ElasticSearch, limiting what queries can be made to the engine, by the final users.

## Push, open bugs, etc.
Feel free to push code to this repository. Anything you want, go to the [issue tracker](https://github.com/henvic/vehikel/issues/).

## Code style
For PHP, [PSR2](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md) shall be used. The code doesn't use it in a proper way as of now.
